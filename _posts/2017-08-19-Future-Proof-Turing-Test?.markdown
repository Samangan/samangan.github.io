Silly question time! Can we ever have a simple and effective CAPTCHA that would work even against human-level AI? 

<br>

## Current CAPTCHA Tech
Over the years CAPTCHAs have evolved from those annoyingly hard to read words to image based tests that combine the need for natural language understanding and image recognition.

As advances in text recognition software outpaced the current CAPTCHA technology, there was a cat and mouse game 
where CAPTCHAs were trying to make their text harder for the bots to read. It worked up to a point, but eventually it 
was easier for the bots to read then the humans. Using images is a natural next step but it will only be a matter of time before bot AIs can reasonably understand natural language
and have a vast understanding of real world objects. 

<br>
Some CAPTCHAs get really creative like this chess CAPTCHA as seen on [lichess](https://lichess.com).

Google's latest 'invisible' [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/invisible.html) takes a fresh approach using  much more data 
that looks at patterns of bots to determine if you are a bot. Things like mouse movements, ip addresses, and more are used to determine if you could be a bot.
Google made the logical choice to bring AI to an AI fight.

<br>
## Where can we move from here?

We are sliding ever closer to AIs with the capacity to mimic human behavior. I believe we will soon reach a point where AI can easily seem
human in a non-physical context (The uncanny valley is a hard problem). Google is ahead of the game with it's own approach, but just for fun 
I was wondering if there was a 100% fool proof turing test we could give a human to prove they are not an AI.

Eventually we will have human-like AI personal assistants. These AIs will surely handle important tasks for us, but sometimes we would want to ensure
that we were talking to a real life human and not an AI personal assistant. 

So what can we do? Is there anything we could show a human-level AI that would be simple for us but impossible for them?
The other day I was thinking about visual and auditory illusions. I believe we could utilize these human brain defects to easily verify that you are a real
human being and not an AI imposter. Only human brains ship with these very specific brain bugs. AIs will have bugs [entirely unique to them.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/12/15271874/ai-adversarial-images-fooling-attacks-artificial-intelligence)
We could also attempt to utilize these bugs in the CAPTCHAs but I assume that there will be a vast number of different human-level AIs as well (also they will probably get more updates than our brains).

<br><br>
Below are some examples of what these illusion based CAPTCHAs could look like:

## "Are the A and B squares the same color?"

<br>

## "Which line is longer, top or bottom?"

<br>

## "Which inner circle is bigger, left or right?"

<br>

## "Are the images moving to you? Yes or No"

The future is *definitely* going to be a weird place. 
But I think it's poetic that our defects could end up being our strengths.
